Day - 2:
--------
es modules
React JS

react is just v in MVC, angular is mvc 

React features:
---------------
- what is react
- single page application
- immutabliity
- purity
- virtual dom
- unidirectional data flow
- declarative
- how to install react
 
- js library
- from facebook 2013 
- UI
- v in MVC
- component
- state
- props
- JSX

singple page application:
--------------------------
- index.html
- google maps
- gmail
- facebook
- drive
- twitter

- much faster than tradition web apps
- react router


declarative:
------------
demo.html
<html>
<p id="para">hai</p>

Real DOM:
---------
<my-date></my-date>
onclick
onsubmit


we never interact with actual DOM

immutabliity:
-------------
- immutable variable can never be changed
- Strng name = 'naga'
  name = name.toUppercase()// 
  s.o.p(name)
  
- w.r.t objects and arrays
  let person = {id: 1, name: 'naga'}
  person.name = "nagaraju setti"
  let p = person;
- we should never mutate state directly, 
  mutate state only through setState({name: 'nagaraju setti'})  
  
- Redux state can be modified only through
  reducers
- mutations are centralized, improving debugging
  capabilities
- code looks cleaner and simpler to understand

Purity:
-------
- pure function or pure component
- A react component is a pure component when 
  its output in only dependant on its props
- all functional components are pure components  

Virtual DOM:
------------
DOM: (Document Object Model)
----
- a tree representation of the page
- <html> is called as node

React keeps a copy of the DOM

- browser two operations: repaint and reflow

index.html:
<html>
<p>hai</p>
<div>boss</div>
</html>

DOM:
html
 p
   hai, good evening
 div
  boss
  
index.html:
<html>
<p>hai, good evening</p>
<div>boss</div>
</html> 

virtual dom:
-------------
html
  p
   hai, good evening
  div 
   boss

- react is going to apply changes and performs
  unique update to the real DOM, by changing
  elements that need to be changed at run time
  
Unidirectional data flow:
-------------------------
- one way data flow means:
1. state is passed to the view and to child comp from parent
2. actions are triggered by that view
3. actions are going to update state
4. state change is passed to the view

how to install react js:
------------------------
> node js
> create-react-app

react.development.js
react-dom.js
babel.js

- transpiling will happen at build time
- webpack 

.babelrc

yarn


npm tool

all modules from centerl repository 
maven

npm start:

create-react-app added a few other commands
build: to build react app files in the build 
      folder 
	  npm build 
test: to run testing suite
      npm test
eject: to eject from create-react-app
       npm eject	  


Webpack:
--------
- is a tool that will compile our js modules

- react features
- what is react
- create-react-app
- our first react app
- project directory structure
- babal

webpack
jsx
